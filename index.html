                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p>
                    Introductory Physics classes are often considered some of the most challenging offerings for
                    students not focused in the sciences, and even for those studying in other scientific fields. This
                    demographic of students greatly benefits from tools designed to help visualize common physics
                    problems, which is frequently a suite of tools provided in a guided lab environment. The issue with
                    lab focused physics curricula is the prohibitive cost of equipment. We aim to cut down on barrier to
                    entry by providing an alternative experience - an augmented reality focused application for
                    simulating and modifying common lab systems. The application is proposed as a packaged, portable
                    experience capable of running on medium-spec portable hardware.

                <div class="update update_one">
                    <h3>Update One</h3>
                    <p>
                        Initially I worked on creating a live simulation program that could take user input and
                        translate it to object interactions, like applying a force to an object, or changing the
                        coefficient of friction live.
                        This ended up being very unpredictable, most likely due to my poor understanding of the Unity
                        engine's core loop.
                        Below is an example of this test simulation.
                    </p>

                    <div class="simulation_examples">
                        <img src="imgs\week_one\SlideAnimation.gif"
                            alt="Live time simulation of a cube being boosted across surfaces of different frictional coefficients.">
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        I ultimately decided that predetermined simulations with initial variables would be easier to
                        implement and more accurate,
                        so I decided to create three example simulations. All three are shown below. From left to right:
                        the launcher,
                        the energy ramp, and the velocity ramp. I also created a graph mesh display, shown in the
                        background of each example,
                        that will be discussed next.
                    </p>

                    <div class="simulation_examples">
                        <img src="imgs\week_one\simulation_examples\LaunchAnimation.gif" alt="">
                        <img src="imgs\week_one\simulation_examples\EnergyAnimation.gif" alt="">
                        <img src="imgs\week_one\simulation_examples\RampAnimation2.gif" alt="">
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        The last thing I did for this first update is write a custom graph mesh display. In summary, I
                        provide the script with a series
                        of points. These points are then either resampled down to an acceptable number, or fed directly
                        into a mesh creator.
                        The mesh of the graph is scaled to a desired bounding box and then displayed. I found that the
                        performance was great, but later
                        I would end up favoring a different graphing method.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <hr class='dotted' />

                <div class="update update_two">
                    <h3>Update Two</h3>
                    <p>
                        The second update focused on the user interface, primarily the concept of reactive design. As
                        this application is being made for
                        arbitrary mombile devices, it needs to be able to work on a myriad of aspect ratios and pixel
                        densities. I found that Unity's scaling
                        system was lacking, so I implemented my own additional tool that added more flexibility to the
                        components - specifically the ability
                        to reference either screen height or width based on their size - sort of like CSS minmax.
                        Really, most of what I implemented UI design wise was to
                        make the experience similar to using CSS.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At this point, I had two major developments. Firstly was a main menu that could hold an
                        arbitrary number of simulations. When a user selected
                        a simulation from this menu, it would instantiate itself and switch to the AR view. This AR view
                        is the second development.
                        It had a primitive graph display at the top where the user could cycle through the different
                        types ofgraphs available for the simulation they had chosen. Below is both the main menu and the AR view.
                    </p>
                    <div class="simulation_examples">
                        <img src="imgs\week_two\simulation_examples\MainMenuScroll.gif" alt="">
                        <img src="imgs\week_two\simulation_examples\EnergyDemo.gif" alt="">
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        This update may appear to have less content than the prior, but in terms of hours invested, they're on par
                        with one another. It took a lot of experimentation and interation to make my custom UI scaling components,
                        but it was well worth the effort. In future updates, they were integral to making the layout as responsive
                        as I needed it to be.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <hr class='dotted' />

                <div class="update update_three">
                    <h3>Update Three</h3>
                    <p>
                        Now that I had functional simulations and a basic user interface, it was time to start implementing the 
                        augmented reality portion of the application. This meant using the Vuforia SDK within Unity, which overall
                        was an easy experience. After setting up the Vuforia SDK as per their developer guides, I was able to set tracking
                        to ground plane and spawn some test objects. This was a huge milestone for me, as now I had an actual augmented reality 
                        application with the core of the necessary logic. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Beyond building to mobile devices and actually implemented AR into the application, I also redesigned the main menu to be a bit
                        more device friendly. I also began work on the control panel, which will evolve into the way the user interacts with the simulations.
                        At this stage, the control panel simply listed adjustable variables and allowed for the user to slect a vlaue via a clamped slider.
                    </p>
                    <div class="simulation_examples">

                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Perhaps the most important thing is this update was the implementation of posing the siimulation. This includes: position, translation,
                        rotation, and scale. This means that the user has full control over where and to what scale the simulation is shown in the real world.
                        Below are two videos showing the different abilities. Teh third video demonstrates object permanence.

                        The biggest setback for this update was dealing with touch controls, specifically filtering taps over UI elements. It took some experimenting to
                        work as envisioned, but now eveything runs smoothly.

                    <h3>Update Four</h3>
                    <p>
                        This final update focused on making a better graph view. The previous graph view and graph mesh were lacking in visibility and context,
                        so I completely overhauled the entire graph making and displaying system. Everything shown is rendered as part of Unity's UI class,
                        meaning that it is both performant and compliant with the UI scaling. It took several iterations to get to this point, and its has further to go,
                        but it is serviceable in its current condition. At this moment, the graph display shows line graphs for each tracked variable, options to enable/disable
                        multiple variables, and automatic bounding box sizing for the graph. The graph menu & variable manipulation is shown below.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A simpler, but still important change is the new 'top bar' where the primitive graph display was previously located. Now, it displays a toggle for the graph
                        and houses the back button to return to the main menu. This is also shown below.
                    </p>

                        For SURE 2022, this is as far as I was able to go with my project. I plan on continuing my work, gathering data, and drawing conclusions.
